🏏 T20 CRICKET ANALYSIS DASHBOARD
📌 OVERVIEW
This project analyzes and visualizes T20 cricket data using Power BI, Python, and Excel. It provides deep insights into player performances, team comparisons, and match trends through interactive dashboards. The dataset includes historical match records, player statistics, and web-scraped data.

📂 PROJECT STRUCTURE
🔹 1. DATA PROCESSING & PREPROCESSING
📜 t20_data_preprocessing.ipynb
Jupyter Notebook for data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering.

Handles missing values, outliers, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Uses Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for preprocessing.

📁 t20_csv_files/
Contains raw and processed CSV files related to matches, teams, and players.

Used as an input source for Power BI and Python scripts.

📁 t20_json_files/
Stores structured cricket data in JSON format (fetched from APIs/web scraping).

Used for dynamic data retrieval and integration.

📁 web_scrapping_codes/
Python scripts for extracting real-time cricket data from online sources.

Uses BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, and Selenium for web scraping.

🔹 2. POWER BI DASHBOARD & ANALYTICS
📊 Codebasics Cricket Best 11.pbix
Power BI file with a detailed Cricket Analysis Dashboard.

Includes DAX measures, calculated columns, filters, and interactive visuals.

Key Features:

Match Performance Overview (Runs, Wickets, Strike Rate, Economy Rate).

Player Comparison (Batsmen vs. Bowlers, Head-to-Head Analysis).

Team Analysis (Win/Loss Ratio, Powerplay Performance, Death Overs).
